# questfor92

My quest to join the 92 Club.

I'm using effectively the official 92 Club rules, but essentially I'm going by:

* No friendlies.
* Men's first team League, FA Cup or League Cup games, or a top level European club competition. 
* I'm 100% behind the Women's game, but I'm not including Women's games in my rules.
* No Youth Cup or games.
* If a team drops out of the League and then returns (eg - Stockport County dropping out of the league in 2011, but returning in 2022) will not need a revisit if it had been visited in the first spell in the League - *HOWEVER* I am intending to revisit those grounds once the 92 has been completed in order to give me something else to do with my life.
* Visiting a ground while it was in Non League will not count if that team is then promoted to the League.
