# questfor92

My quest to join the 92 Club.

I'm using effectively the official 92 Club rules, but essentially I'm going by:

* Only the current stadium counts - Upton Park doesn't count for West Ham, only the London Stadium will do.
* No friendlies.
* Men's first team League, FA Cup or League Cup games, or a top level European club competition. 
* I'm 100% behind women's football, but I'm not including women's games in the quest.
* No Youth Cup or reserve/development squad games.
* If a team drops out of the League and then returns (eg - Stockport County dropping out of the league in 2011, but returning in 2022) will not need a revisit if it had been visited in the first spell in the League - *HOWEVER* I am intending to revisit those grounds once the 92 has been completed in order to give me something else to do with my life.
* Visiting a ground while it was in Non League will not count if that team is then promoted to the League.
* If a team moves stadium, the new stadium must be visited within 12 months.
